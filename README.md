# PIR-Based-Intruder-Alert-System-with-Power-Saving
This project aims to develop a PIR-based intruder alert system designed to detect human presence, log violations, and operate efficiently in environments with power constraints. Security is crucial in remote or off-grid locations, such as cabins, warehouses, or storage facilities, making encrypted communication a necessary requirement.
